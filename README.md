# Workspace_creator
This is a workspace creator customised to my own needs

## Usage 

- First copy the .obsidian folder to the home directory
- Then run the script

```
./create_wkps.sh 
Enter the number of workspaces to create : 2
Creating workspace 1
Enter the name of the first workspace : wks1
Creating workspace 2
Enter the name of the first workspace : wks2
```

- This will create notes, notes/Pictures, nmap folders respectively
- This will also create a markdown file with the name of the workspace in the notes folder
- This will copy the customised .obsidian folder to the notes folder
